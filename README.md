# Automatic Street Light Control

## Introduction:

### Description:
Automatic Street Light Control is an automated system which controls the street lights. The street lights are switched on according to how dark the environment gets. For example, just before the sun sets, that is, at around 6 PM, only a few street lights have to turn on. After the sun sets, that is, at 7 PM, some more street lights turn on. After 8 PM, as it is very dark, all the street lights need to be switched on. During the morning, none of the street lights will be on. The aim of the project is to use the lights efficiently and save power whenever possible.


### Objective
* At high intensity of light, in the morning, all the street lights are turned off.
* At moderate intensity of light, in the evening, only a few street lights are turned on.
* At low intensity of light, at night, all street light will be turned on.
