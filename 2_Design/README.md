### Power Supply
Supplies power of 5V to the microcontroller and LDR.

### ATmega328 Microcontroller
It is used to automate the street light control system.

### Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)
Its a type of resistor which changes its resistance based on the intensity of light in the environment. Here, it detects how dark the environment is and accordingly turns on the street lights.

### Light-Emitting Diode (LED)
Its a device that emits light when current flows through it. Here, it is used to emulate the street lights.
